# Advanced Cobra Script Extender

You probably reached this page because a mod asked you to download and install ACSE. If this the case then please follow the instructions below.

### Installing ACSE

- Download the ACSE Zip package (download link on the left) and extract the files. Browse to the corresponding game title folder in the release
directory (e.g: "Release/Jurassic World Evolution2/" or "Release/Planet Zoo/"). Currently only Jurassic World 1 and 2, and Planet Zoo are supported.
- Copy the 'ACSE' folder to your clipboard and paste it (or drag and drop it) into the game 'OVLData' folder (e.g. "/Jurassic World Evolution 2/Win64/OvlData/" or "/Planet Zoo/Win64/OvlData/").
- You don't need to copy any other file/folder. Only the corresponding release 'ACSE' folder is required by other mods. 
- If you completed these steps correctly, you will have an 'ACSE' folder in the same directory as the game GameMain folder.

Note: If you have a previous version of ACSE installed, the new one must overwrite the old one. There cannot be two version of ACSE
installed at the same time.

### Uninstalling ACSE

- Browse to your game folder and remove the ACSE folder.
